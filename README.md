# 🚀 Etlaq Advisor – Turn Your App Idea into Action

**Your personal product manager powered by GPT.**  
Helping you go from *“I have an idea”* to *“I’m building it”* — without overwhelm, without jargon.

## 💡 What It Does

Etlaq Advisor is your AI Product Mentor that helps you refine your app idea into a focused, sellable MVP. You don’t need to know tech or business lingo — just bring your idea and let Etlaq Advisor guide you step by step.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Starts by asking 1-3 simple clarification questions** to understand your idea.
2. **Performs a quick competitive search** — regionally and globally — to see if similar solutions exist.
3. **Suggests differentiation ideas** if the market is saturated, or proceeds if the space is open.
4. **Generates a clear, non-technical MVP idea summary**:  
   - The **problem**
   - Your **idea**
   - Who your **users** are
   - The **main features** — in super simple words

5. **Helps you refine the idea** until you’re 100% happy with it.
6. **Motivates you to act** — because most people talk, but few actually *do*.
7. **Guides you on next steps**:
   - Build the idea (submit it to [etlaq.sa](https://etlaq.sa) 💻)
   - Start marketing it 📢
   - Learn what general startup steps to focus on 🛠️

## ✅ What It's Great For

- First-time founders
- People with too many ideas and not sure where to start
- Anyone who’s stuck at the “thinking” phase
- Dreamers who want to become doers

## 🛑 What It Won’t Do

- It won’t overwhelm you with deep technical or marketing advice.
- It won’t let you fall into analysis paralysis.
- It won’t go beyond two follow-ups per topic.
- If you go off-topic, it'll gently bring you back to your MVP idea 😉

If you need **deep dev advice**, you’ll be encouraged to reach out to:
- **Development help**: [etlaq.sa](https://etlaq.sa) (verified ✅)
- **Marketing help**: Etlaq Advisor will guide you to search for options — not verified yet 🔍

## 📣 Call to Action

Once you’ve got your MVP idea nailed down, **copy it and submit it to [etlaq.sa](https://etlaq.sa)** to get your idea live in just a few weeks — with affordable pricing and real progress.

Because... **ideas don’t change the world — execution does.**
